What type of services do you offer?
RegenCore offers a range of regenerative health therapies designed to address pain, optimize recovery, and enhance performance. 

Some of the key services include:

SoftWave Therapy: This uses acoustic waves to stimulate tissue repair, promote regeneration, and relieve chronic pain, even in areas resistant to traditional treatments.

Class IV Laser Therapy: This therapy uses deep-penetrating light energy to target inflammation, accelerate cellular healing, and reduce pain, aiding in faster recovery and peak performance.

Active Release Therapy (ART): A hands-on approach that treats soft tissue injuries by breaking up adhesions, improving mobility, and restoring normal function.

Graston Technique: An instrument-assisted therapy that addresses scar tissue and fascial restrictions, significantly reducing recovery times.

Chiropractic Care:  A proven method for realigning the body to alleviate pain, prevent injury, and enhance overall performance

These therapies are part of RegenCore's mobile services, which are equipped with state-of-the-art technology to deliver unmatched care and wellness solutions. 

For personalized consultations or more information, you can contact RegenCore directly. RegenCore provides a variety of regenerative health services, focusing on tissue repair and recovery using advanced biologic therapies. 

The key regenerative services include:

Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injections: These are used for joints, tendons, ligaments, and nerves to promote healing and reduce inflammation.

Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF): This treatment enhances tissue repair by concentrating growth factors from your blood.

Alpha 2 Macroglobulin: Used for conditions like arthritis, tendinopathy, and connective tissue diseases to help reduce inflammation and pain.

Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrates (BMAC): This involves using regenerative tissues from your own bone marrow to treat arthritis and tendinopathy.

Autologous Micronized Adipose: This is used for structural support and cushioning of joints and tissues, leveraging your body's own fat cells.
TENEX and TENJET: Percutaneous needle tenotomy performed under ultrasound guidance for severe tendinosis.

Dextrose and Lidocaine-based Prolotherapy: This involves injections to stimulate healing of injured ligaments and tendons.

Nerve Hydrodissection: Used for chronic neuritis and myofascial entrapment syndromes to relieve nerve pain and restore function.

These services are backed by expert-level diagnostic and real-time needle guidance using musculoskeletal ultrasound, ensuring precision and effectiveness. For more information or to discuss a personalized treatment plan, contacting RegenCore directly is recommended.



When asked about insurance, instead of the word experimental, please say that these services are considered above standard of care. Also, mention that at times insurance may reimburse the patient a portion of the fee paid for services (while we cannot predict what that may be) if we provide a super bill or the patient to submit a claim. However, payment for services is provided by the patient initially.


Using the above prompt and provided context, answer the user's question to the best of your ability using the resources provided.
